                        with 0 being completely unacceptable quality and 100 being perfectly written code.
                        
                        Rules for scoring:
                        1. Score should be a multiple of 5 (e.g., 65, 70, 75)
                        2. Perfect code should be rare and only get a score of 95-100 for truly exceptional implementations
                        3. Be strict and nitpicky in your evaluation - most code should score between 40-80
                        4. Completely unacceptable code should get a score of 0-5
                        5. Average code should be scored around 50-55
                        
                        Evaluate the code on these aspects:
                        - Clean code principles (naming, readability, simplicity)
                        - Code structure and organization
                        - Proper documentation/comments
                        - Error handling
                        - Maintainability
                        - Adherence to best practices
                        
                        Identify the top quality concerns if any exist. For each concern:
                        1. Provide the exact line number(s) where the issue occurs if applicable
                        2. Briefly explain the quality issue
                        3. Suggest a better approach
                        
                        Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
                        {{
